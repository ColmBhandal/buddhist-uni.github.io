> A recurrent topic on any market visit is dog meat (which is not sold in Hoi An’s markets). Visitors seem to be most eager to find what they consider tabooed flesh, and when they do, they take a picture, stare for a while, and leave disgusted. One comment I have heard repeatedly in such circumstances was that 'they eat everything'.
Such comments are hardly trivial.
[...] If “they eat everything”, “they” must be uncivilized, savage...

> Rather than “total prohibition”, [the Tongan word "taboo"'s] original denotation had to do with sacredness and uniqueness.

> Many of [Hoi An's new restaurants] specialized in fish and seafood, but others served expensive animal flesh attributed with virility, strength, and sexual potency, such as he-goat or wild animals. The virility and potency embedded in the flesh of these animals was further exacerbated by the hot, libido-enhancing spices such as chili, lemongrass, ginger, and *rau răm*.
[...] these venues were practically brothels.

> When I inquired about this public display of what I felt was total breach of proper social conduct, these public acts were dismissed as unimportant. I was told that these men were drunk

> ... such transgressions and the ambivalence they entail involve a measure of anxiety that seems to spice up the food and make it uniquely palatable.
