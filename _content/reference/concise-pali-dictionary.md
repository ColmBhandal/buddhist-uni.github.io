A large and terse glossary of PƒÅli terms, the CPED lent itself easily to digitization and so has enjoyed a thriving second life on the internet.

It has been reversed into an English-Pali Dictionary, incorporated into a variety of apps for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pali-english-dictionary/id1472853947) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tummosoft.paliplus) and has even been translated into [Mandarin Chinese](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_odZA8b0KP75oHgdjHk7urfqkIJupWQ5/view?usp=drivesdk).
