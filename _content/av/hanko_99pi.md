> Hanko, sometimes called insho, are the carved stamp seals that people in Japan often use in place of signatures. 

> Hanko seals are made from materials ranging from plastic to jade and are about the size of a tube of lipstick.
The end of each hanko is etched with its ownerâ€™s name, usually in the kanji pictorial characters used in Japanese writing.
This carved end is then dipped in red cinnabar paste and impressed on a document as a form of identification.
