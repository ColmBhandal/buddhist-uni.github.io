Bhante Sujato walks us through [this deep sutta](/content/canon/mn140), one of his (and, I must say, my) favorites, giving us a bit more info on the commentarial background story as well as the suttaâ€™s parallels.

You can find [part two of the video here](https://youtu.be/YsXmwkMhd40){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"}.
