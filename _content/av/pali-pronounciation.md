A few dozen Pāḷi terms clearly pronounced to give an idea of its sound.

See [Professor Khan's Forvo page](https://forvo.com/user/sameeruddowlakhan/pronounced-words/pi/) for more such recordings and [ReadingFaithfully](https://readingfaithfully.org/pali-word-pronunciation-recordings/) for some Pāli names.
