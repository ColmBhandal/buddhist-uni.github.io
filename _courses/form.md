## What is the Form of Buddhism?
The Form of Buddhism is the “religious” side of Buddhism: the history, institutions, rituals and externalities that socially define the religion.

Whether Buddhism even is a “religion” at all is, of course, a matter of some controversy. Is it a philosophy? A movement? A practice? An aesthetic? Who even counts as “a Buddhist”?

In defining the bounds of “who is Buddhist”, some “middle way” may be desirable, between:
1. The conservative, “prescriptive” definition (the Buddha once said that only enlightened beings count as his followers!)
2. And the completely liberal, “historical” definition (the Buddha's life has materially impacted everything from ancient trade routes, to Islamic art, Christian conflicts, IKEA designs, software engineering practices… nearly every human life today)

In searching for such a middle way, I take on Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of Religion here, and say that “Religion is whatever you take seriously.” 

The forms of Buddhism, then, are the various ways that people have looked back to the Buddha for guidance and inspiration, and the many ways they have found to reshape their lives in response to what they've seen.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with [the fundamentals of Buddhism]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %}).


## Course Outline
This course proceeds in three parts: history, community, and practice. 

The history portion of the course is the longest and describes the entire history of Buddhism. The second section analyzes this history to highlight the role of the monastic community, and the third section zooms all the way in to the individual practices.

### Introduction
On forms and the formless.

- [On Science Religion and Culture - Yuttadhammo.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_fOph2ODVm1U7bSxZiBnVpYDjR0qtUJ/view?usp=drivesdk)
    - Here we get Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of religion which I referenced earlier, and his introductory thoughts on the cultural forms of Buddhism.

- [What Buddhism Offers (2009-10-19) - Yuttadhammo.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1izjyBM-fE8HBbpeZIpmYNvAS_rA4ODVf/view?usp=drivesdk)
    - Bhante Yuttadhammo then gives us his thoughts on the essence of Buddhism.

### Part 1: History
#### Textbook

Your main text for this third of the class is the excellent book by Robinson et al: **Buddhist Religions: A Historical Introduction**. 

Note: there are a few editions of this book. I have taken my chapter numbers below from the fourth edition. My apologies if your chapter numbers vary from mine and I hope you can figure out the mapping anyway.
