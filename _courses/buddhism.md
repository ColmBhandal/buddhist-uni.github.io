## What is Buddhism?
Buddhism is the religion founded by the Buddha in approximately the 5th century BCE in the Ganges River Valley. The Buddha's philosophy may be summed up as “every effect has a cause”. The Buddha then applied this philosophy to the problems at the heart of the human condition: mortality, anxiety, suffering and evil. 

He discovered that the cause of our spiritual disease is our erroneous, subconscious perception that we are at the center of the universe. And why not? Everything we hear, see, touch, smell, taste, feel or think happens to us! We are, in every moment, at the center of our own experience, so it's natural that we should think of ourselves as a real being at the center of things. 

But this perspective, which the Buddha called “ignorance,” causes us to suffer when the things that we cling to or identify with (our body, our career, etc) inevitably decay and die. Being associated with what we don't like, being separated from what we like — trying to grasp, pin down and build a “self” out of the constantly changing, flowing things of the world is an inherently stressful project, no matter how it's conceived. 

The religion the Buddha founded is thus the set of contemplations, practices, and yes, even rituals and beliefs, which have been designed to help the practitioner to overcome these “selfish” tendencies and to attain liberation from the tyranny of “me” and “mine.”

Next, we listen to a couple Dhamma talks by two of my own dear teachers, giving us an introduction to Buddhism. What do you notice about these talks? What surprises you? What's interesting? Jot down whatever observations and questions you have after listening, and as you go through the course we'll refer back to these notes.

### Textbook
For those looking for a thorough, academic introduction to Buddhism, I recommend:

#### An Introduction to Buddhism by Peter Harvey

This textbook can be read alongside the course, providing the basic framing for the rest of the course. The class is arranged according to its outline and some of its topics — rituals, history, sects — will not be covered by the other works. 

The textbook remains, however, optional, as the free materials below provide an excellent overview of the Buddha and his teachings all on their own. Feel free to just read the rest without the “connective tissue” of Harvey’s textbook, though total beginners to Buddhism might well be advised to give the textbook a chance, as its framing and contextualization will be helpful, if somewhat dry.

### Who was the Buddha?

*Readings parallel to Chapters 1–2 of Harvey*

#### [The Biography of Shakyamuni Buddha - Ven Master Hsing Yun](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15HWz48ZECEgsTvs3-UsBBMCEMPB2cLf2NhGOnksoGGY/edit?usp=drivesdk)
A simple but powerful retelling of the Buddha's life story from a renowned modern master.

    - The importance of belief in Karma is in trusting that our actions have consequences.

    - Who was the Buddha in his own words? In this story, he calls himself the “Tathagata” or “Truth-Arriver”, and he responds to a question on what will become of him after his death. The Buddha explains that he doesn't talk in such terms, as he has overcome all such notions as “I am the body” or “I am the mind” so how could such a question ever be answered? He ends the discourse by famously saying that all he teaches is suffering and the end of suffering, thus redirecting our attention from empty philosophical musings to the things that matter most.

### What did the Buddha teach?

*Readings parallel to Ch 3–5 of Harvey*

The next part of the class tackles the teachings. As this section is the primary focus of this course, it is the longest.

#### The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh ([epub](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMSvz64NDhG2xBFLSzSGR-mbZlLpGrhE/view?usp=drivesdk)) ([pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1etQnhIZt2a0_tkFEFC8IaTkfsuYFND_Y/view?usp=drivesdk))

The emotional heart of this course, and one of my favorite books period. Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of “Buddhist Philosophy” proper, we first explore the emotional experience of the Buddhist path, catching a glimpse of its beauty through the eyes and words of one of the world's most celebrated Buddhist teachers.

#### Alternative Presentations of the Dhamma

- Are we morally obligated to meditate? ([on Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/10/21013234/meditation-brain-neuroscience-moral-obligation)) ([pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_0CwIktwO3bg2kUn7QRfsRSegmAhNiGw/view?usp=drivesdk))
    - An example of the many popular press articles reporting on the benefits of meditation


- AN 8:53  Saṅkhitta Sutta  - In Brief.pdf
     - In this early discourse from the Buddhist Canon, the Buddha contextualizes his teachings by listing the character traits that the practice should produce if practiced correctly.
Compare this list with the feeling you got from Thich Nhat Hanh and with the benefits described in the popular article above (and any other information you may have read). Do you notice any differences? Similarities? Does anything on this list surprise you?  Are these three sources (the sutta, the monk and the media) saying the same thing in different words or has something been “lost in translation”?
This discourse is one of the few teachings in the canon (along with the teachings on mindfulness) which the Buddha declared as “categorical”: always applicable and useful in any situation. This sutta gives, better than any other, the overall direction of the teachings, and is a helpful rubric to refer back to.

    - Ven Hong Ci invites us to get off the treadmill of pursuing sense pleasures, and to live fully in the present moment, thus tying together the threads from the above: renunciation, mindfulness and fulfilment.
