## What is the Function of Buddhism?

The Function of Buddhism is to overcome delusion by supporting our cultivation of virtues, mental clarity, and wisdom.

Buddhism supports this “threefold training” by providing both essential, explanatory frameworks and practical guidance. The Buddha himself called this a “Dhamma-Vinaya,” or “Philosophy-Discipline,” but we might simply call it “a way of life” because Buddhism is meant to transform our entire lives from our selfish, restless, addicted, never-satisfied “default mode,” to the pinnacle of human potential — the total eradication of suffering. 

## Prerequisites

This course strives to be a rigorous overview of Buddhism suitable for everyone — from beginners to experienced practitioners alike — and it is recommended for all.

I am satisfied that this course is both rigorous and accurate without compromising its lofty subject.
