max_stretch: 1.33
# max stretch must balance the error of too
# many pixels when kicked up a bucket early,
# against not enough pixels when on a high-res
# screen at max stretch ratio. For the equation
# see: https://bit.ly/whythisratio
# where 0.484111 is 1 - inter_width_ratio
# and 1.5 is the density
