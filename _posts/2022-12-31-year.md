title: Happy New Year
---

This December I'm happy to announce that a new page on [the Pāli Language](/tags/pali-language) has been added to our library.

There you'll find books and papers about Pāli along with a suite of helpful tools, including a selection of [Pāli Dictionaries](/tags/pali-dictionaries) containing, among all the classics, an exciting new grammar app just published this year: [The Digital Pāḷi Dictionary](/content/reference/dpd). If you're a student of Pāli struggling with declension charts, I recommend checking it out!

This month I've also continued to make small technical improvements across the site and add many new items to the library,
such as [this course on the history of Eastern Europe](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNewfxO7LhBoz_1Mx1MaO6sw_) and [this essay by Bhante Sujato on the *karma* of "just" war](/content/essays/war-bright-and-dark_sujato)---both written in response to Russia's (ongoing) invasion of Ukraine this year.

In fact, we've added so much this year that our library now has **[over 2000 items](/content/)!** A big thank-you to all the publishers and authors who've made this milestone possible through their generous offerings.

If you'd like to stay informed about _all_ our new arrivals, subscribe to [one of our RSS feeds](/feed) or follow [OBU on Mastodon](https://digipres.club/@obu) where we'll be "tooting" updates now that we've moved off of Twitter.

As the old year draws to a close, I hope that the coming year will be a good year for everyone.

And thank you, as always, for all the kindness and support in 2022.

Wishing You a Most Happy 2023
