title: Happy New Year
---

This month I'm happy to announce that a new page on [the Pāli Language](/tags/pali-language) has been added to our library.

There you'll find books and papers about Pāli along with a suite of helpful tools, including a selection of [Pāli Dictionaries](/tags/pali-dictionaries) containing, among all the classics, an exciting new grammar tool just published this year: [The Digital Pāḷi Dictionary](/content/reference/dpd). If you're a student of Pāli struggling with *sandhi* or noun declensions, I recommend checking it out!

This month I've also continued to make small technical improvements across the site and add many new items to the library,
such as [this course on the history of Eastern Europe](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNewfxO7LhBoz_1Mx1MaO6sw_) and [this essay by Bhante Sujato on the *karma* of "just" war](/content/essays/war-bright-and-dark_sujato)---both written in response to Russia's (ongoing) invasion of Ukraine this year.

In fact, we've added so much this year that our library now has **[over 2000 items](/content/)!** A big thank-you to all the publishers and authors who've made this milestone possible through their generous offerings.

If you'd like to stay informed about all our new arrivals, you can subscribe to [one of our RSS feeds](/feed) or follow [OBU on Mastodon](https://digipres.club/@obu) where we'll be "tooting" updates now that we've moved off of Twitter.

And thank you, as always, for all the kindness and support this year!  

Wishing You a Most Happy 2023
