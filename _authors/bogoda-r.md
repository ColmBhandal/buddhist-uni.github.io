Robert Bogoda was born in 1918 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. His secondary education was cut short by the sudden demise of his father, which compelled him to work at a modest job as a teacher. While engaged in teaching, he obtained by self study a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Econ from the University of London, specializing in Social Administration.
