Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu was an influential Thai ascetic-philosopher of the 20th century. Known as an innovative reinterpreter of Buddhist doctrine and Thai folk beliefs, Buddhadasa fostered a reformation in conventional religious perceptions in  Thailand and abroad.

Buddhadasa was broadly ecumenical, holding "all religions to be inwardly the same", and encouraged Buddhists to transcend clinging to Buddhism as a "[religion](https://www.suanmokkh.org/books/127)."
