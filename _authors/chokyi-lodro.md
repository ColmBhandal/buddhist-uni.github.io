He was born in 1893 at Sa-ngen or Rekhe Ajam near Katok Monastery in Kham south of Derge.Though he died in 1959 in Sikkim, and is not so well known in the West; he was a major proponent of the Rimé movement within Tibetan Buddhism, and had a profound influence on many of the Tibetan lamas teaching today.

At the age of sixty-seven, he again became seriously ill. Prayers and rituals for his long life were performed, but despite these devoted spiritual efforts, he died. According to Sogyal Rinpoche he died in the "sleeping lion's posture", a yogic posture, and remained in a subtle meditative state for three days.
