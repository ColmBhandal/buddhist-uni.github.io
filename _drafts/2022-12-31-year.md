title: This Year at OBU
---

This month, I'm happy to announce, we've expanded our tools for Pali Scholars with [a new section in the library on the Pali Language](/tags/pali-language).

The bibliography contains papers and books about Pali and a suite of helpful tools for the digital scholar, including a whole section on [Pali Dictionaries](/tags/pali-dictionaries) which contains, among the many classics, an exciting new entry in the genre: [The Digital P캐拷을 Dictionary](/content/reference/dpd) which, while a bit tricky to install, is sure to become a must-have for any student of P캐拷을.

Over the last couple months, we've continued to make minor technical improvements to the site and to add miscellaneous new items to the library, including [this course on the history of Eastern Europe](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNewfxO7LhBoz_1Mx1MaO6sw_) and [this essay on the *karma* of self defense by Bhante Sujato](/content/essays/war-bright-and-dark_sujato) both written in response to the continuing war in Ukraine.

This month we've also migrated off Twitter and are now on [Mastodon](https://digipres.club/@obu), so follow us there (or at [one of our RSS feeds](/feed)) if you'd like to be informed about all the newest additions to our library.

This year, the OBU library has grown considerably. We ended last year with about 1300 items in our library, and we're ending this year with exactly 2000 items. A big thanks to all the publishers and authors who are putting their work out there for free!

Wishing you a very happy new year,  
Khemarato Bhikkhu  
Chief Librarian at The Open Buddhist University
