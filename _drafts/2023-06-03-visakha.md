Dear fellow students!

Vesak is the annual Buddhist holiday in which we celebrate the life of the Buddha: his birth, enlightenment and final quenching.
Lay Buddhists (and monastics alike) may take this day as an opportunity to recommit themselves to the ethical precepts, rekindle or extend their meditation practice, listen to or read some words of Dharma, and/or visit their local temple.

The holiday is usually celebrated on the full moon of May, but it seems that Thailand (where I am) is even slower than usual this year, as we're finally celebrating Vesak today (in June).

So, whether you're as slow as I am, or have celebrated it already, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you: Happy Vesak!

To celebrate, I offer you a new reading list on [**The Buddhist Attitude towards Nature**](https://buddhistuniversity.net/tags/nature)

You'll find a variety of essays, suttas, and talks there to help you think through and learn about how Buddhists do and have related to the natural world and perhaps the works there may even inspire you to get [*Back to Nature* yourself](/content/av/back-to-nature_yuttadhamo)! (Yes, that's a Dhamma talk link ;)

So far this calendar year OBU has added over 200 other new items to [our existing bibliographies](/tags) as well and I'd like to highlight five of those here:

Particularly charming to me has been Trent Walker's thesis on the etherially beautiful Cambodian Dharma Song tradition which he's called ["Stirring and Stilling"](/content/av/stirring-stilling_walker-trent) after his translation of *samvega* and *pasada*. Not only does his website contain recordings of the traditional, Cambodian performances, but it even includes his own rendition of the songs in English!

For those keen to start their own daily chanting practice in the Theravada tradition, [Dhamma Puja](/content/av/dhammapuja) offers an online "karaoke" version of the Abhayagiri daily chants in Pali and English which you may find supportive.
Daily chanting, especially upon waking up and before bed, can do a lot to set the mind in the right direction, and it's no wonder that it's been a staple of monastic life for centuries.

To continue practice even into sleep itself, Ann Heirman has [this article on monastic sleep regulations](/content/articles/sleep-well-sleeping-practices-in_heirman-ann) which is surprisingly inspiring, demonstrating well how the Vinaya is [better thought of as a spiritual aid than as a set of "laws"](/content/papers/vinaya_huxley).

Indeed, even the worldly legal system may be thought of as codifying our collective aspirations, and it was with this in mind that I recently (actually) read [The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights](/content/booklets/udhr).
We have a long way to go before its ambitions are realized, but it's moving to know that (at least on paper) the governments of the world were able to come together and agree, "wouldn't it be nice if..."

Wishing for such a bright future for you (and for us all) this warm, Vesak night,
