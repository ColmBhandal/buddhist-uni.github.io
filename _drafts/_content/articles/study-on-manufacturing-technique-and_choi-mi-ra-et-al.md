> Analysis of the bronze bodhisattva from Pangyo-dong sites in Seongnam by computed tomography, ICP-AES, metallurgical microscope and SEM-EDS had to know manufacturing technique.
> And the origin of the raw material, was investigated using TIMS.
> Results with computed tomography, two bronze bodhisattva produced by lost-wax casting technique with hollow inside and could see the core of the inside.
> Result of component analysis and microstructure observation, material is alloy of copper-tin-lead and made by casting without artificial treatment.
> According to lead isotope ratio analysis result of bronze bodhisattva could be made into galena of the Gyeonggi massif in Korea South.
