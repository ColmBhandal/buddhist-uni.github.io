> Emotional intelligence is established to predict success in leadership effectiveness in various contexts and has been linked to personality factors.
> This paper introduces Dharma Life Program, a novel approach to improving emotional intelligence by targeting maladaptive personality traits and triggering neuroplasticity through the use of a smart-phone application and mentoring.
> The program uses neuroplasticity to enable users to create a more adaptive application of their maladaptive traits, thus improving their emotional intelligence.
> In this study 26 participants underwent the Dharma Life Program in a leadership development setting.
> We assessed their emotional and social intelligence before and after the Dharma Life Program intervention using the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI).
> The study found a significant improvement in the lowest three competencies and a significant improvement in almost all domains for the entire sample.
> Our findings suggest that the completion of the Dharma Life Program has a significant positive effect on Emotional and Social Competency scores and offers a new avenue for improving emotional intelligence competencies.
